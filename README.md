## DSP Tools

Welcome to **DSP Tools**! This project is a collection of image processing utilities, I created to practice programming algorithms and app development.

### Features

- **Background Removal** for PNGs and GIFs using:
    - Flood fill
    - Blob fill
    - Erosion
    - Aliasing/feathering
    - Cropping
- **Spatial Filtering**
    - Blurring
    - Sharpening
    - Edge Detection
- Extended functionality from `preprocessing.py` (imported from my [clash_star_tracker](https://github.com/Brmanzo/clash_star_tracker) project) to explore additional image processing applications.

### Goals

I plan to add more useful features and tools in the future. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

### Future Ideas
- File conversion
- Pixel art downscaling
- Image slicing/ Grid detection
- FFT-based edge detection
- Preprocessing tools for ML inference
