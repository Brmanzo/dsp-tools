    Given an image of a single channel, and a threshold, the function returns the position
    of both events in the image.
    
    Behavior is specified through a string split by commas and allows for the following options:
        mode: 
            "absolute threshold": the threshold is meant to be taken from zero.
            "relative threshold": the threshold is meant to be taken from the previous value.
            "stat comparison": compares when the two chosen statistics diverge by a given threshold

        stat:
            "minimum", "maximum", or "average": to determine which statistic to compare with threshold
            In "stat comparison" mode, this is used to determine the first value to compare against the second.
                "min"/"max"/"average" < "min"/"max"/"average": to compare the first statistic against the second statistic.

        axis:
            "by row", or "by col": to indicate if iterating through image vertically or horizontally

        trig1:
            "first rise": the first trigger occurs when rising through threshold (prev is less than threshold, current is greater)
            "first fall": the first trigger occurs when falling through threshold (prev is greater than threshold, current is less)
            "from start": first event is not returned, and only returns the second event.
            "divergence": the first trigger occurs when the first statistic diverges from the second statistic by the threshold.

        when:
            "next": the second trigger occurs at the immediate next occurrence of the second trigger.
            "last": iterates to the end of the image, only remembering the final occurence of the second trigger.

        trig2 + Optional second condition:
            "rise", or "fall": indicates the behavior of the second trigger similar to the first trigger.
            "convergence": indicates the second trigger occurs when the first statistic converges with the second statistic by the threshold.
            
            Optional second condition can be indicated when more than one word is included in this argument.
                "while min", or "while max": specifies an additional condition for each trigger.
                "<", or ">": comparison operator relating stat to following threshold
                {float}: absolute threshold to be compared to for this second condition.
